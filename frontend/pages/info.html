      <h2 class="display-6">About KartAi</h2>
      <p>
        KartAi is a research project conducted by Kartverket, Norkart, Kristiansand Municipality, and the University of Agder with financial support from the Regional Research Fund Agder. The main purpose of the project is to make the processing of building cases in the municipality more efficient. This will be achieved by improving the quality of the property register (matrikkelen), and map databases using Ai.
        The KartAi project has three sub-goals:
        <p>
            1. Buildings will be identified by the help of different data sources like, laserdata, aerial photo and crow sourcing. This will be done by creating a “geodata lake”, with data sources that are optimized for Ai and big data analysis. <br>
            2. Provide a better decision-making basis for municipal case management. The project will identify buildings under 50 square meters in a selected area in Kristiansand by using and developing new Ai algorithms from the mentioned “geodata lake” This will typically include buildings that are exempt from the municipal application requirements.<br>
            3. Ensure more efficient processing of cases through reliable and automated quality improvement of the national property register (matrikkelen) and map databases in dialog with residents.</p>
        <p>This application belongs to the first subgoal, the generated data can be used to train Ai to recognize buildings.</p>
